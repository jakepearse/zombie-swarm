This documnet treats the Server and Simulation as a single application, for the  actual work of handling web socket intergration we have selected to use the Cowbo Erlang web server. We are only using a small subset of the functionality provided by Cowboy and as such it's very simple to set up and deploy.
\begin{description}
\item{enviromental grid set up:} Provide a way to set the evnvirtomntal varibales via web socket \begin{itemize}\item Grid arrity: The size of the two dimensional array, the grid will be square so a single number is sufficent to set the arrity.
\item{Tile size} We have removed the user capability to specify the size of Tiles, the tile size is linked to the sensory distance of entities. Going forward tile size will be a fixed constant..
\item{Start the simulation}
Interaction with entities
