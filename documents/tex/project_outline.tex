The aim of this project is to create a realistic simulation of a zombie apocalypse using a number of zombies and humans to see what emergent behaviour occurs.
Everyone is more or less familiar with the idea that zombies exhibit some kind of swarming behaviour at least superficially similar to soldier ants.As such we are going to design our zombies to create and act as swarms.
As we intend to make a realistic simulation,our system must have believable internal logical consistency.
