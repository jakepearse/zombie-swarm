The \verb+swarmer+ application has been implemented in a hierarchical process structure using Erlang Supervisor processes\footnote{http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html} that comes as part of the OTP\footnote{http://www.erlang.org/doc/design\_principles/des\_princ.html} \footnote{http://learnyousomeerlang.com/what-is-otp} (Open Telecom Platform). This means that all processes are children of a supervisor process within the applications' supervision tree. Supervisors are responsible for the stopping, starting and restarting of their child processes.
%
\verb+Swarmer+ has one main supervisor, called the \verb+swarm_sup+, this is responsible for the \verb+tile_sup+, \verb+viewer_sup+, \verb+human_sup+, \verb+zombie_sup+, \verb+supplies_sup+ supervisor processes and the \verb+environment+ process.

Apart from \verb+swarm_sup+, all of the supervisors are created with a \verb+simple-one-for-one+ restart strategy, meaning that each of the children will be identical processes using the same code, and should be researted if they crash. \verb+swarm_sup+ is using a \verb+one-for-one+ strategy which can restart it's child processes without affecting the others\footnote{http://www.erlang.org/doc/design\_principles/sup\_princ.html\#id68643}.

Using an Erlang and OTP application with a process supervision architecture provides a standard set of interface functions, behaviours and more advanced error tracing and reporting functionality.
