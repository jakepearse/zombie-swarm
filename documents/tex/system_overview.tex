\subsection{Supervisor-Child Architecture}
% another intro to OTP
% what is a SupervisorSupervisor-Child Architecture
% why this is useful
    % gen-servery stuff
The \verb+swarmer+ application has been implemented as a hierarchical process structure using Erlang Supervisor processes\footnote{http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html}. This means that all processes are children of a supervisor process within the applications supervision tree.


\subsection{System Architecture}
% Overall Architecture
% Link back to evolution and design documents
% Include a new, final Architecture Overview diagram

\subsection{Communication}
% intro to the Communication of processes
% lots of little Communication diagrams
% one overall, simplified one
