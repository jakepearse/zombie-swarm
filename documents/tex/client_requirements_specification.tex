\section{Client Requirements Specification\\{\small\tt{J.~Mitchard,R.~Hales}}}

\subsection{The Client}
The client is the user facing part of our system, and as such it will need to not only clearly represent the information that the application simulates, but also look appropriate and aesthetically pleasing.

\subsection{What We Need}
This first section will explain the parts of the client that we feel are most critical to the workings of our system. 

We need the client to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item visually represents the current state of the simulation,
	\item display the continuous changing states within the system efficiently,
	\item be cross platform,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item this includes looking and functioning the same across different systems,
	\end{itemize}
	\item allow the user to start, reset and pause the simulation,
	\item allow the user to control certain parameters of the simulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What We Hope to Achieve}
We would like the client to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item visually represents the current state of the simulation in an aesthetically pleasing manner,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item we would like the visualisation to display as much information as possible, without overcomplicating what is shown to the user,
	\end{itemize}
	\item seamlessly display the continuous changing states within the system efficiently,.
	\item provide intuitive controls for the user.
\end{itemize}
